# relache
Relache is a music festival taking place in Bordeaux. I was in charge of the front-end and back-end developpement of the website http://relache.fr. 
Note that this is my first real project, so the code might seem a little messy considering I don't use frameworks yet (exception made of jquery).
The main page of the website is the "programmation" one, which deals with all the artists and relevant information that are in the database. 
To make this website, I used mostly :
- HTML5/CSS3
- Javascript and jQuery : google analytics, slick (a slider), instafeed (live instagram displaying the posts with the #relache2015 hashtag, some personnal code to add/remove class, a smoothscroll, and the Google map API.
- PHP/MySQL : home, "programmation", "lieux" and "artiste" pages are built with this language.
